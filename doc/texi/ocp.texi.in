OpenCubicPlayer is a music file player. It is derived from the @emph{Cubic Player 2.0appe}
for DOS which was developed by Niklas Beisert, which you can find at
@url{https://www.cubic.org/player/}

If you encountered a bug in OpenCubicPlayer please report in the link above.
Many people complain about music files not being played properly (especially
with module formats). Please keep in mind that the original tracking/sequencing
program is ~always~ the reference for correct playback. If a music file sounds
different compiled to another player, please keep in mind that perhaps the other
program does not play it correct. This is espicially true for Amiga 4channel
modules. As those files can be produced using various trackers (Noise-, Sound-,
Protracker and many, many more) and sadly all of those trackers are slighty
different, a general player like OpenCubicPlayer can not play ~all~ modules
correctly. We try to come as close to a reasonable mixture of them all, so that
most modules are played correctly. However certain features of one tracker
permit another feature of a different tracker.
