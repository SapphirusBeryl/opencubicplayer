If you hit a crashbug (and you have compiled yourself from source):

Go back into the source directory, and rerun configure with the same options
and settings, just add --with-debug:

./configure --prefix=/usr/local --with-debug



The force rebuild everything again and install (cflags changes isn't detected
by make)

make clean all install



The run ocp again within gdb, and give gdb command r for run (and hit enter)

gdb ocp
(gdb) r



Next time ocp crashes, give gdb command bt (and maybe other commands if you are in contact with
me). This is the stuff I want sent to me (along with config.log from the
source tree).

(gdb) bt
#1 123123
#2 123123
#3 32131



In order to quit gdb and ocp, give gdb the command quit.

(gdb) quit
