Original authors of Cubic Player is the Cubic Team (www.cubic.org)
DOJ and Pascal really rocks on that kind of software, so all respect goes to
those guys who made this player.

Linux rewrite/porting is done by Stian Skjelstad (and hopefully a couple of
other people soon). The player itself is just rewritten to Linux, and assembler
stuff in wrapped into C instead of using external assembler. With time
C-replacers will be availble as a start for those who intend to port this
beyond to other architechures. Filehandling is more-or-less redone from
scratch, with the old code-design in my mind.
